ROOST_METHOD_HASH=toString_0fdd7046da
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=toString_bbffdadaa2

Here are some test scenarios for the given toString() method:

Scenario 1: Test toString() with all fields populated

Details:
  TestName: toStringWithAllFieldsPopulated()
  Description: This test verifies that the toString() method correctly generates a string representation of the PaymentPlanProposalRequestPaymentPlan object when all fields are populated with non-null values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of PaymentPlanProposalRequestPaymentPlan and set values for installmentAmount, interestRate, and termLength fields.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the instance.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to compare the returned string with the expected string format, including the field names and their corresponding values.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the toString() method properly includes all field names and their respective values in the generated string representation.
  This test ensures that the toString() method provides a comprehensive and accurate string representation of the object when all fields have valid values.

Scenario 2: Test toString() with null fields

Details:
  TestName: toStringWithNullFields()
  Description: This test checks how the toString() method handles null values for the installmentAmount, interestRate, and termLength fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of PaymentPlanProposalRequestPaymentPlan without setting any field values, leaving them as null.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the instance.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to compare the returned string with the expected string format, ensuring that null fields are represented correctly (e.g., "null" or empty string).
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the toString() method handles null field values gracefully and includes them in the generated string representation.
  This test ensures that the toString() method does not throw any exceptions or produce unexpected results when fields are null.

Scenario 3: Test toString() with empty fields

Details:
  TestName: toStringWithEmptyFields()
  Description: This test verifies how the toString() method handles empty string values for the installmentAmount, interestRate, and termLength fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of PaymentPlanProposalRequestPaymentPlan and set empty string values for installmentAmount, interestRate, and termLength fields.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the instance.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to compare the returned string with the expected string format, ensuring that empty fields are represented correctly (e.g., empty string or "").
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the toString() method handles empty field values appropriately and includes them in the generated string representation.
  This test ensures that the toString() method does not omit or misrepresent empty fields in the string representation.

Scenario 4: Test toString() with special characters in fields

Details:
  TestName: toStringWithSpecialCharactersInFields()
  Description: This test checks how the toString() method handles special characters or non-alphanumeric values in the installmentAmount, interestRate, and termLength fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of PaymentPlanProposalRequestPaymentPlan and set values containing special characters or non-alphanumeric characters for installmentAmount, interestRate, and termLength fields.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the instance.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to compare the returned string with the expected string format, ensuring that special characters are properly escaped or handled in the generated string representation.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the toString() method correctly handles and represents special characters in the field values without causing any formatting issues or unexpected behavior.
  This test ensures that the toString() method is robust and can handle a variety of input values, including special characters, in the field values.

These test scenarios cover different aspects of the toString() method, including handling of populated fields, null fields, empty fields, and special characters in fields. They aim to ensure that the toString() method generates the expected string representation of the PaymentPlanProposalRequestPaymentPlan object under various conditions.
