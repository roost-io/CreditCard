================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-470: Unrestricted Exposure of Object's Internal State
Issue: The getPreviousNotifications method is public and without any restriction, which can lead to the exposure of object's internal state. An attacker can manipulate the internal state of the object, leading to unexpected behavior.
Solution: Encapsulate the object's internal state. You can use the 'private' access modifier to restrict access to the object's internal state and provide public getter and setter methods to control access.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The @NotNull annotation can lead to exposure of sensitive information through error messages. If the previousNotifications field is null, the application will throw a ConstraintViolationException with a detailed error message, which could provide an attacker with insights into the internal workings of the code.
Solution: Customize error messages to avoid revealing sensitive information. Use exception handling to catch the ConstraintViolationException and return a custom error message that doesn't expose any sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The getPreviousNotifications method doesn't perform any validation on the returned data. This could lead to potential security risks, such as injection attacks or data leakage.
Solution: Implement input validation mechanisms such as sanitization and filtering to ensure the security of the data. Use the @Valid or @Pattern annotation to validate the input data.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify if getPreviousNotifications() returns the correct value

Details:
  TestName: testGetPreviousNotificationsReturnsCorrectValue.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the getPreviousNotifications() method returns the correct value that was previously set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest object and use the setPreviousNotifications() method to set a known value.
  Act: Invoke the getPreviousNotifications() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the returned value matches the value that was set before.
Validation:
  This test validates the correct functioning of the getter method for previousNotifications. The expected result is based on the principle that a getter method should return the same value that was set using the setter method.

Scenario 2: Test to verify if getPreviousNotifications() returns not null value

Details:
  TestName: testGetPreviousNotificationsReturnsNotNull.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the getPreviousNotifications() method never returns a null value as defined by the @NotNull annotation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest object without setting a value for previousNotifications.
  Act: Invoke the getPreviousNotifications() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the returned value is not null.
Validation:
  This test validates that the getter method for previousNotifications adheres to the @NotNull annotation. The expected result is based on the principle that a getter method should never return null when the @NotNull annotation is present.

Scenario 3: Test to check the interaction between getPreviousNotifications() and equals()

Details:
  TestName: testGetPreviousNotificationsInteractionWithEquals.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the equals() method takes into account the value of previousNotifications.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest objects with the same values for previousNotifications.
  Act: Invoke the equals() method to compare the two objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the equals() method returns true.
Validation:
  This test validates that the equals() method correctly considers the value of previousNotifications. The expected result is based on the principle that two objects with the same values for their fields should be considered equal.

Scenario 4: Test to check the interaction between getPreviousNotifications() and hashCode()

Details:
  TestName: testGetPreviousNotificationsInteractionWithHashCode.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the hashCode() method takes into account the value of previousNotifications.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest objects with the same values for previousNotifications.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode() method on both objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the returned hashCodes are equal.
Validation:
  This test validates that the hashCode() method correctly considers the value of previousNotifications. The expected result is based on the principle that two objects with the same values for their fields should have the same hash code.
