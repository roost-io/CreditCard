ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getCardLast4_4a5c700ec4

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The provided code validates the length of the cardLast4 string, but it doesn't validate the content. This could lead to improper data being accepted, such as non-numeric characters.
Solution: Add a pattern constraint to validate the input. The validation should ensure that only numeric characters are accepted. An example implementation could be @Pattern(regexp = "\\d{4}")

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The last four digits of a card number are considered sensitive information. The code does not seem to include any encryption or hashing mechanism for storing or transmitting this data, which could lead to exposure of sensitive information.
Solution: Make sure sensitive information is encrypted or hashed when stored or transmitted. You could use Java's built-in cryptography libraries for this purpose.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The function getCardLast4() is public, which means it can be accessed by any object. This could potentially lead to information exposure if it's accessed by malicious code.
Solution: Limit the access to sensitive data. You could make the function protected or private, or control access through a more secure method.

"""
Scenario 1: Testing the getCardLast4 method with a valid card number
Details:
    TestName: testGetCardLast4WithValidCardNumber
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getCardLast4 method when provided with a valid card number. The target scenario is when the user input is correct and valid.
    Execution:
        Arrange: Create an instance of BalanceAlertRequest and set a valid card number using the setCardLast4 method.
        Act: Invoke the getCardLast4 method.
        Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate if the returned value is equal to the expected card number.
    Validation:
        The assertion aims to verify if the getCardLast4 method is correctly retrieving the card number that was previously set. The expected result is the correct card number, as this is the standard and correct behavior of the getter method.

Scenario 2: Testing the getCardLast4 method with an empty string
Details:
    TestName: testGetCardLast4WithEmptyString
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getCardLast4 method when provided with an empty string. The target scenario is when the user input is incorrect and invalid.
    Execution:
        Arrange: Create an instance of BalanceAlertRequest and set an empty string using the setCardLast4 method.
        Act: Invoke the getCardLast4 method.
        Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate if the returned value is null or empty.
    Validation:
        The assertion aims to verify if the getCardLast4 method is correctly handling the scenario when an empty string is set as the card number. The expected result is null or an empty string, as this is the standard behavior of the getter method when the setter is provided with invalid data.

Scenario 3: Testing the getCardLast4 method without setting a card number
Details:
    TestName: testGetCardLast4WithoutSettingCardNumber
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getCardLast4 method when no card number is set. The target scenario is when the user does not provide any input.
    Execution:
        Arrange: Create an instance of BalanceAlertRequest without setting a card number.
        Act: Invoke the getCardLast4 method.
        Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate if the returned value is null.
    Validation:
        The assertion aims to verify if the getCardLast4 method is correctly handling the scenario when no card number is set. The expected result is null, as this is the standard behavior of the getter method when the setter is not invoked.
