================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error
Issue: The function does not check or incorrectly checks the length of the paymentDueDate, which can lead to a truncation of the value.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize the input before processing. Ensure that the length of paymentDueDate is within the expected range.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The function does not validate if paymentDueDate is null before calling a method on it, which can lead to NullPointer Exception.
Solution: Always check if the object reference is not null before calling a method on it. Implement null object design pattern if applicable.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The function might contain debug code that could expose sensitive information or is not suitable for production.
Solution: Ensure that debug code is not included in the final production build. Use logging judiciously and avoid logging sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function does not validate the input paymentDueDate which can lead to unexpected behavior.
Solution: Always validate inputs and ensure they are within the expected range and format.

"""
Scenario 1: Test the method with a valid payment due date
Details:
  TestName: testPaymentDueDateWithValidDate
  Description: This test scenario is meant to check if the method correctly sets the payment due date when it is given a valid date.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of BalanceAlertRequest. Define a valid LocalDate object.
  Act: Invoke the paymentDueDate method with the valid date as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual payment due date against the expected date.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the payment due date is correctly set when a valid date is provided. This test is significant in ensuring that the payment due date functionality works correctly.

Scenario 2: Test the method with a null payment due date
Details:
  TestName: testPaymentDueDateWithNullDate
  Description: This test scenario is meant to check if the method correctly handles a null date.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of BalanceAlertRequest.
  Act: Invoke the paymentDueDate method with null as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual payment due date against null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the payment due date is null when the method is invoked with null as a parameter. This test is significant in ensuring that the method correctly handles null values.

Scenario 3: Test the method with a payment due date in the past
Details:
  TestName: testPaymentDueDateWithPastDate
  Description: This test scenario is meant to check if the method correctly sets the payment due date when it is given a date in the past.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of BalanceAlertRequest. Define a LocalDate object representing a date in the past.
  Act: Invoke the paymentDueDate method with the past date as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual payment due date against the expected past date.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the payment due date is correctly set when a past date is provided. This test is significant in ensuring that the payment due date functionality works correctly even with past dates.

Scenario 4: Test the method with a payment due date in the future
Details:
  TestName: testPaymentDueDateWithFutureDate
  Description: This test scenario is meant to check if the method correctly sets the payment due date when it is given a date in the future.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of BalanceAlertRequest. Define a LocalDate object representing a date in the future.
  Act: Invoke the paymentDueDate method with the future date as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual payment due date against the expected future date.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the payment due date is correctly set when a future date is provided. This test is significant in ensuring that the payment due date functionality works correctly even with future dates.
