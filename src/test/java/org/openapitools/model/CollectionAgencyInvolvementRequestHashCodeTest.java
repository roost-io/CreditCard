ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_44411a81c8

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: The hash function used in hashCode() could be predictable, which can lead to collision attacks.
Solution: Consider using a stronger hash function that produces less predictable outputs.

Vulnerability: CWE-470: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
Issue: The code does not perform any validation checks on the types of files that can be uploaded. This could lead to arbitrary file upload, which can result in execution of malicious files.
Solution: Implement checks to ensure only safe and expected file types can be uploaded.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: If the 'previousNotifications', 'responseStatus', and 'cardLast4' variables are used in SQL queries, they could be vulnerable to SQL Injection if they are not properly sanitized.
Solution: Use prepared statements, parameterized queries or ORM libraries to handle SQL queries.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: If the 'previousNotifications', 'responseStatus', and 'cardLast4' variables are reflected on a webpage without proper sanitization, they could be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
Solution: Ensure that any user-supplied input is properly encoded or escaped before it is reflected on a webpage.

"""
Scenario 1: Testing hashCode method with equal objects

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeWithEqualObjects
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the hashCode method generates the same hash code for two equal objects.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create two CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest objects with identical properties.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both objects.
  Assert: Assert that the hash codes generated for both objects are the same.

Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the hashCode method is consistent and generates the same hash code for two equal objects. This is important to ensure the correct functioning of hash-based collections such as HashSet, HashMap, etc.

Scenario 2: Testing hashCode method with unequal objects

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeWithUnequalObjects
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the hashCode method generates different hash codes for two unequal objects.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create two CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest objects with different properties.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both objects.
  Assert: Assert that the hash codes generated for both objects are not the same.

Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the hashCode method is capable of generating different hash codes for two unequal objects. This is crucial for the correct functioning of hash-based collections as it helps in reducing the number of collisions.

Scenario 3: Testing hashCode method with null properties

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNullProperties
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the hashCode method can handle objects with null properties.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest object with null properties.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the object.
  Assert: Assert that the hash code generated is not null.

Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the hashCode method can handle objects with null properties. This is critical as it ensures that the application does not break when encountering objects with null properties.

Scenario 4: Testing hashCode method with different order of properties

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeWithDifferentOrderOfProperties
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the order of properties does not affect the hashCode method.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create two CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest objects with identical properties but in a different order.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both objects.
  Assert: Assert that the hash codes generated for both objects are the same.

Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the order of properties does not affect the hash code generated by the hashCode method. This is crucial as it ensures that the hashCode method is consistent regardless of the order of properties.
