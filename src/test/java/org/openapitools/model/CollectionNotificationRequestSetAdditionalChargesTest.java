Here are some JUnit test scenarios for the setAdditionalCharges method:

Scenario 1: Set Valid Additional Charges

Details:
  TestName: setValidAdditionalCharges
  Description: This test checks if the setAdditionalCharges method correctly sets a valid additional charges value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setAdditionalCharges method.
  Act: Call the setAdditionalCharges method with a valid string value representing additional charges.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the additionalCharges field is set to the provided value.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the additionalCharges field is properly updated when a valid value is passed to the setter method.
  This test ensures that the setter method functions as expected for valid input.

Scenario 2: Set Empty Additional Charges

Details:
  TestName: setEmptyAdditionalCharges
  Description: This test checks if the setAdditionalCharges method handles setting an empty string as additional charges.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setAdditionalCharges method.
  Act: Call the setAdditionalCharges method with an empty string value.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the additionalCharges field is set to an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the additionalCharges field is set to an empty string when an empty string is passed to the setter method.
  This test ensures that the setter method can handle empty input and sets the field accordingly.

Scenario 3: Set Null Additional Charges

Details:
  TestName: setNullAdditionalCharges
  Description: This test checks if the setAdditionalCharges method handles setting a null value as additional charges.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setAdditionalCharges method.
  Act: Call the setAdditionalCharges method with a null value.
  Assert: Use assertNull to verify that the additionalCharges field is set to null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the additionalCharges field is set to null when a null value is passed to the setter method.
  This test ensures that the setter method can handle null input and sets the field accordingly.

Scenario 4: Set Additional Charges with Special Characters

Details:
  TestName: setAdditionalChargesWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test checks if the setAdditionalCharges method can handle additional charges containing special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setAdditionalCharges method.
  Act: Call the setAdditionalCharges method with a string value containing special characters.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the additionalCharges field is set to the provided value.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the additionalCharges field is correctly set when the input contains special characters.
  This test ensures that the setter method can handle and store additional charges with special characters.

These test scenarios cover different aspects of the setAdditionalCharges method, including setting valid values, handling empty and null input, and handling special characters. They aim to ensure that the method functions as expected under various conditions.
