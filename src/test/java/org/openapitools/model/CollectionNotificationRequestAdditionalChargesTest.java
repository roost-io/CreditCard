================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation
Issue: The `additionalCharges` method does not sanitize or validate user input, potentially allowing cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
Solution: Use a whitelisting approach to validate and sanitize user input. Consider using OWASP ESAPI's `Validator` class or a similar library to ensure input safety.

Vulnerability: CWE-285: Improper Authorization
Issue: The `additionalCharges` method lacks proper authorization checks, allowing potentially unauthorized access to sensitive data.
Solution: Implement proper authorization checks using Java's built-in security features, such as JAAS or Java Security Manager, to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site
Issue: The `additionalCharges` method does not validate the `additionalCharges` parameter, which could lead to URL redirection attacks.
Solution: Use a whitelist approach to validate URLs and ensure they are trusted. Consider using OWASP ESAPI's `Validator` class or a similar library to validate URLs.

Vulnerability: CWE-1188: Insecure Default Initialization of Resource
Issue: The `additionalCharges` method does not initialize the `additionalCharges` field securely, potentially leading to data exposure.
Solution: Initialize the `additionalCharges` field with a secure default value, such as an empty string or a default value that does not reveal sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CVE-2019-9208: Jackson Deserialization Vulnerability
Issue: The `additionalCharges` method uses Jackson for deserialization, which may be vulnerable to deserialization attacks.
Solution: Update Jackson to the latest version or use a secure deserialization mechanism, such as JSON Schema validation, to prevent deserialization attacks.

================================================================================
Here are the test scenarios for the `additionalCharges` method:

**Scenario 1: Test setting additional charges to a valid value**

Details:
TestName: setAdditionalChargesToValidValue
Description: This test checks if the `additionalCharges` method sets the `additionalCharges` field to a valid value.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a new `CollectionNotificationRequest` object.
Act: Call the `additionalCharges` method with a valid string value, e.g., "10.99".
Assert: Use `assertEquals` to verify that the `additionalCharges` field is set to the expected value.
Validation:
This test verifies that the `additionalCharges` method correctly sets the `additionalCharges` field to a valid value. This is important because the `additionalCharges` field is a required field and must be set correctly for the `CollectionNotificationRequest` object to be valid.

**Scenario 2: Test setting additional charges to an empty string**

Details:
TestName: setAdditionalChargesToEmptyString
Description: This test checks if the `additionalCharges` method sets the `additionalCharges` field to an empty string.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a new `CollectionNotificationRequest` object.
Act: Call the `additionalCharges` method with an empty string value, e.g., "".
Assert: Use `assertEquals` to verify that the `additionalCharges` field is set to an empty string.
Validation:
This test verifies that the `additionalCharges` method correctly sets the `additionalCharges` field to an empty string. This is important because an empty string may be a valid value for the `additionalCharges` field in certain scenarios.

**Scenario 3: Test setting additional charges to a null value**

Details:
TestName: setAdditionalChargesToNull
Description: This test checks if the `additionalCharges` method throws a `NullPointerException` when setting the `additionalCharges` field to a null value.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a new `CollectionNotificationRequest` object.
Act: Call the `additionalCharges` method with a null value.
Assert: Use `assertThrows` to verify that a `NullPointerException` is thrown.
Validation:
This test verifies that the `additionalCharges` method correctly throws a `NullPointerException` when setting the `additionalCharges` field to a null value. This is important because the `additionalCharges` field is a required field and cannot be null.

**Scenario 4: Test getting additional charges after setting it**

Details:
TestName: getAdditionalChargesAfterSetting
Description: This test checks if the `getAdditionalCharges` method returns the correct value after setting the `additionalCharges` field using the `additionalCharges` method.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a new `CollectionNotificationRequest` object.
Act: Call the `additionalCharges` method with a valid string value, e.g., "10.99".
Act: Call the `getAdditionalCharges` method to retrieve the value of the `additionalCharges` field.
Assert: Use `assertEquals` to verify that the retrieved value matches the expected value.
Validation:
This test verifies that the `getAdditionalCharges` method correctly returns the value of the `additionalCharges` field after it has been set using the `additionalCharges` method. This is important because the `getAdditionalCharges` method is used to retrieve the value of the `additionalCharges` field, which is a required field.

**Scenario 5: Test setting additional charges multiple times**

Details:
TestName: setAdditionalChargesMultipleTimes
Description: This test checks if the `additionalCharges` method correctly sets the `additionalCharges` field multiple times.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a new `CollectionNotificationRequest` object.
Act: Call the `additionalCharges` method with a valid string value, e.g., "10.99".
Act: Call the `additionalCharges` method again with a different valid string value, e.g., "20.99".
Assert: Use `assertEquals` to verify that the `additionalCharges` field is set to the latest expected value.
Validation:
This test verifies that the `additionalCharges` method correctly sets the `additionalCharges` field multiple times. This is important because the `additionalCharges` field may need to be updated multiple times in certain scenarios.
