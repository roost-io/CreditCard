================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-470: Unrestricted File Upload
Issue: The method 'getResponseStatus()' does not validate the input it receives, which can lead to unrestricted file upload. This can allow an attacker to upload malicious files that can be executed in the server context.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure only valid and safe data is processed. You can use a whitelist of accepted inputs or a blacklist of dangerous inputs.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The method 'getResponseStatus()' might expose sensitive information as it returns the response status. If it contains sensitive data, it can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access.
Solution: Ensure that no sensitive data is included in the response status. Implement proper access control to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: If the 'getResponseStatus()' method is used to construct SQL queries, it can be vulnerable to SQL injection if the input is not properly sanitized. An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to gain unauthorized access or perform malicious actions.
Solution: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Avoid constructing SQL queries using string concatenation.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: If the 'getResponseStatus()' method returns data that is directly included in an HTML response, it can be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. An attacker can inject malicious scripts that can steal sensitive information.
Solution: Use proper output encoding when including the data in an HTML response. Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of any potential XSS vulnerabilities.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the getResponseStatus() method returns the correct responseStatus.

Details:
  TestName: testGetResponseStatus.
  Description: The test is meant to check if the getResponseStatus() method is functioning as expected and returns the correct responseStatus that was previously set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest object and use the setResponseStatus() method to set a known responseStatus.
  Act: Invoke the getResponseStatus() method on the object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned responseStatus against the known responseStatus set earlier.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getResponseStatus() method correctly retrieves the responseStatus of the CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest object. If the test passes, it indicates that the getResponseStatus() method is functioning as expected.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the getResponseStatus() method returns null when no responseStatus has been set.

Details:
  TestName: testGetResponseStatusReturnsNull.
  Description: The test is meant to check if the getResponseStatus() method returns null when no responseStatus has been set for the CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest object without setting a responseStatus.
  Act: Invoke the getResponseStatus() method on the object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned responseStatus is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getResponseStatus() method correctly handles the case where no responseStatus has been set and returns null. If the test passes, it indicates that the getResponseStatus() method is robust and handles edge cases correctly.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the getResponseStatus() method returns the latest set responseStatus.

Details:
  TestName: testGetResponseStatusReturnsLatest.
  Description: The test is meant to check if the getResponseStatus() method returns the latest set responseStatus when the responseStatus of the CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest object has been changed multiple times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest object and use the setResponseStatus() method to set multiple known responseStatuses in succession.
  Act: Invoke the getResponseStatus() method on the object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned responseStatus against the latest known responseStatus set.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getResponseStatus() method correctly retrieves the latest set responseStatus of the CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest object. If the test passes, it indicates that the getResponseStatus() method is functioning as expected even when the responseStatus is changed multiple times.
