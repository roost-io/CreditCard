================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-480: Use of Incorrect Operator
Issue: This is not exactly a security issue but a common mistake in Java when using '==' operator to compare objects instead of 'equals()'.
Solution: Always use 'equals()' method for object comparison. In your code, you're already using it, which is good.

Vulnerability: CWE-495: Private Data Leakage
Issue: Again, not applicable to this code, but in general, if your class has any private data that should not be leaked, make sure not to expose them in methods like equals(), hashCode() or toString().
Solution: Always be careful about what information you're exposing in your public methods.

"""
Scenario 1: Validate equals method when same instance is passed

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsMethodWithSameInstance
  Description: In this scenario, we are testing the equals method by passing the same instance of CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest. The equals method should return true as it is the same instance being compared.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest.
  Act: Call the equals method on the instance and pass the same instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  The equals method should return true when the same instance is passed as a parameter because the instance is being compared with itself. This test ensures that the equals method correctly identifies and handles this scenario.

Scenario 2: Validate equals method when null is passed

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsMethodWithNull
  Description: In this scenario, we are testing the equals method by passing null. The equals method should return false as null is not equal to any instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest.
  Act: Call the equals method on the instance and pass null as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The equals method should return false when null is passed as a parameter because null is not equal to any instance. This test ensures that the equals method correctly identifies and handles this scenario.

Scenario 3: Validate equals method with different class object

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsMethodWithDifferentClassObject
  Description: In this scenario, we are testing the equals method by passing an object of a different class. The equals method should return false as the object is not of the same class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest and another object of a different class.
  Act: Call the equals method on the CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest instance and pass the different class object as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The equals method should return false when an object of a different class is passed as a parameter because the equals method checks for class equality as well. This test ensures that the equals method correctly identifies and handles this scenario.

Scenario 4: Validate equals method with different CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest instances having same data

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsMethodWithSameDataDifferentInstances
  Description: In this scenario, we are testing the equals method by passing a different instance of CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest but with the same data. The equals method should return true as the data in both instances is the same.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest with the same data.
  Act: Call the equals method on one instance and pass the other instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  The equals method should return true when two instances of CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest have the same data. This test ensures that the equals method correctly identifies and handles this scenario.

Scenario 5: Validate equals method with different CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest instances having different data

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsMethodWithDifferentDataDifferentInstances
  Description: In this scenario, we are testing the equals method by passing a different instance of CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest with different data. The equals method should return false as the data in both instances is not the same.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest with different data.
  Act: Call the equals method on one instance and pass the other instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The equals method should return false when two instances of CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest have different data. This test ensures that the equals method correctly identifies and handles this scenario.
