ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=equals_ded257778a

Scenario 1: Verify equality when two objects are identical

Details:
  TestName: equalsOnIdenticalObjects
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method correctly identifies two identical objects as equal. It checks for reference equality by using the same object in the comparison.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a single CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest object with specified field values: `previousNotifications`, `responseStatus`, and `cardLast4`.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the object, passing itself as the argument.
  Assert: Verify that equals returns true, indicating reference equality.
Validation:
  Confirm that the equals method correctly handles the case where the same object is compared to itself. This verifies the functionality of the first condition (`this == o`).

---

Scenario 2: Verify inequality when compared to null

Details:
  TestName: equalsOnNullObject
  Description: This test verifies that the equals method returns false when the object is compared to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest object with any arbitrary field values.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the object, passing null as the argument.
  Assert: Confirm that the equals method returns false, indicating inequality.
Validation:
  Ensure that the equals method adheres to its contract by correctly handling cases where the comparison object is null.

---

Scenario 3: Verify inequality when comparing objects of different classes

Details:
  TestName: equalsOnDifferentClass
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when comparing a CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest object to an object of another class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest object and another object from a different class (e.g., String) with arbitrary data.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest object, passing the instance of a different class as the argument.
  Assert: Verify that the equals method returns false, indicating class mismatch.
Validation:
  Confirm that the method correctly checks the class of the incoming object and returns false if the classes do not match.

---

Scenario 4: Verify equality when two objects have identical field values

Details:
  TestName: equalsOnIdenticalFieldValues
  Description: Test to ensure that the equals method returns true when two CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest objects have identical field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest objects with the same field values for `previousNotifications`, `responseStatus`, and `cardLast4`.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on one object, passing the other object as the argument.
  Assert: Verify that equals returns true, indicating value-based equality.
Validation:
  Ensure that the method uses the Objects.equals logic to compare fields and verifies structural equality.

---

Scenario 5: Verify inequality when field values differ

Details:
  TestName: equalsOnDifferentFieldValues
  Description: This scenario checks that the equals method returns false when two CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest objects differ in at least one field value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest objects, each with distinct values for at least one field (`previousNotifications`, `responseStatus`, or `cardLast4`).
  Act: Call the equals method on one object, passing the other object as the argument.
  Assert: Verify that equals returns false, indicating object inequality due to differing field data.
Validation:
  Validate that the equals method correctly identifies inequality based on field-level differences.

---

Scenario 6: Verify equality when all fields are null

Details:
  TestName: equalsOnBothObjectsWithNullFields
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns true when both objects have null values for all fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest objects, each with null values for `previousNotifications`, `responseStatus`, and `cardLast4`.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on one object, passing the other object as an argument.
  Assert: Confirm that equals returns true, indicating equality due to null fields.
Validation:
  Verify that the Objects.equals method handles null values correctly across fields, and ensures equality when both objects have all fields set to null.

---

Scenario 7: Verify inequality when one object has null fields, and the other has non-null values

Details:
  TestName: equalsWhenOneObjectHasNullFields
  Description: This test checks that the equals method returns false when one CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest object has null values for fields while the other has non-null values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two objects where one has null values for all fields (`previousNotifications`, `responseStatus`, and `cardLast4`), and the other has valid string values for all fields.
  Act: Call the equals method on one object, passing the other object as the argument.
  Assert: Ensure that equals returns false, indicating inequality due to mismatched field values.
Validation:
  Validate that the equals method correctly handles cases where field values differ between two objects, particularly when null values are involved.

---

Scenario 8: Verify equality when field values differ by case sensitivity

Details:
  TestName: equalsOnCaseInsensitiveFieldComparison
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when the string field values differ due to case sensitivity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest objects with field values that are identical except for differences in character case (e.g., "abc" vs "ABC").
  Act: Invoke the equals method on one object, passing the other object as the argument.
  Assert: Verify that equals returns false, indicating inequality because of case-sensitive string comparisons.
Validation:
  Assess whether the method enforces case-sensitive comparisons for string fields like `previousNotifications`, `responseStatus`, and `cardLast4`.

---

Scenario 9: Verify equality when partial fields match but others differ

Details:
  TestName: equalsWhenPartialFieldValuesMatch
  Description: Check that the equals method returns false when only one or two fields match between two CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two objects where one or two field values (`previousNotifications` or `responseStatus`) are the same, but at least one field (`cardLast4`) is different.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on one object and pass the other as the argument.
  Assert: Confirm that the equals method returns false, indicating inequality due to partial mismatch.
Validation:
  Validate the method's ability to check equality based on the combined comparison of all fields, not individual matches.

---

Scenario 10: Verify behavior when cardLast4 has invalid size

Details:
  TestName: equalsOnInvalidCardLast4Size
  Description: Test to ensure equals correctly handles invalid scenarios when `cardLast4` does not meet the required length constraint (4 characters).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CollectionAgencyInvolvementRequest object with an invalid `cardLast4` (e.g., less than or more than four characters). Create another valid object for comparison.
  Act: Invoke equals on the valid object, passing the invalid object as an argument.
  Assert: Verify that the equals method returns false due to discrepancy in field validity.
Validation:
  Assess whether field-specific constraints like the size validation in `cardLast4` indirectly affect the comparison outcome.
