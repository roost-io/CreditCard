================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error
Issue: The LocalDate object returned by the getCurrentDate() method is not validated or sanitized. This can lead to numeric truncation errors if the date is processed in a way that assumes specific lengths for fields.
Solution: Implement validation and sanitization checks for the LocalDate object before returning it. This can prevent numeric truncation errors.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The getCurrentDate() method is public, which means it can be accessed from anywhere within the application. If this method is used to retrieve sensitive data, it could lead to privacy violations.
Solution: Consider making the getCurrentDate() method private or protected, or ensure that it does not return sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The code includes several unused import statements. If these were used for debugging and forgotten to be removed, they can expose internal workings of the application, leading to potential security risks.
Solution: Remove unused import statements to maintain a clean code base and reduce potential attack surface.

"""
Scenario 1: Test when getCurrentDate method returns the current date

Details:
  TestName: testGetCurrentDateReturnsCurrentDate
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getCurrentDate method returns the correct current date. The target scenario is when the currentDate is set to the current system's date.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a BalanceAlertRequest object and set the currentDate to the system's current date.
  Act: Invoke the getCurrentDate method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned date against the system's current date.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getCurrentDate method correctly returns the date that was set. The expected result is the system's current date as that's the value we set for currentDate. This test is significant in ensuring the getCurrentDate method works correctly and returns the correct date.

Scenario 2: Test when getCurrentDate method is invoked without setting a date

Details:
  TestName: testGetCurrentDateWithoutSettingDate
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the getCurrentDate method when a date has not been set. The target scenario is when the currentDate is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a BalanceAlertRequest object without setting the currentDate.
  Act: Invoke the getCurrentDate method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned date is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getCurrentDate method returns null when a date has not been set. This test is significant in ensuring the getCurrentDate method behaves correctly when a date has not been set.

Scenario 3: Test when getCurrentDate method is invoked after setting a different date

Details:
  TestName: testGetCurrentDateAfterSettingDifferentDate
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getCurrentDate method returns the correct date after a different date has been set. The target scenario is when the currentDate is set to a date different from the system's current date.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a BalanceAlertRequest object and set the currentDate to a date different from the system's current date.
  Act: Invoke the getCurrentDate method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned date against the date that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getCurrentDate method correctly returns the date that was set. The expected result is the date that was set as that's the value we set for currentDate. This test is significant in ensuring the getCurrentDate method works correctly and returns the correct date.
