================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: The code does not seem to use any credentials, but it's crucial to ensure that no hard-coded credentials are used in the actual implementation. Hard-coded credentials can lead to unauthorized access if the code is exposed or decompiled.
Solution: Always retrieve sensitive information from secure, encrypted sources at runtime. Use environment variables to store such information securely.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The method apiInfo() does not perform any form of authentication before performing its operations. This could potentially allow unauthorized access to the API information.
Solution: Ensure that all methods, especially those that interact with APIs, have some form of authentication. Use Spring Security or similar libraries to secure your endpoints.

Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: The method apiInfo() is generating API information with a URL to an external site. If this URL is manipulated, it could redirect users to an untrusted site.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize URLs to ensure they are safe and cannot be manipulated to redirect users to untrusted sites.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The method apiInfo() exposes API information without any apparent restriction. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive information is not unnecessarily exposed. Use proper access controls and secure methods to protect sensitive information.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if apiInfo method returns a valid OpenAPI object

Details:
  TestName: testApiInfoReturnsValidOpenAPIObject
  Description: This test is meant to check if the apiInfo method returns a valid OpenAPI object with the correct details.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as there is no dependency on other methods or data.
  Act: Invoke the apiInfo method without any parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected OpenAPI object.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the apiInfo method correctly constructs and returns a valid OpenAPI object with the correct details. The significance of this test is to ensure that the OpenAPI configuration is correctly set up.

Scenario 2: Test to check the title of the OpenAPI object returned by apiInfo method

Details:
  TestName: testApiInfoReturnsCorrectTitle
  Description: This test is meant to check if the apiInfo method returns an OpenAPI object with the correct title.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as there is no dependency on other methods or data.
  Act: Invoke the apiInfo method without any parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual title of the OpenAPI object against the expected title.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the apiInfo method correctly sets the title of the OpenAPI object. The significance of this test is to ensure that the OpenAPI configuration displays the correct title.

Scenario 3: Test to check the description of the OpenAPI object returned by apiInfo method

Details:
  TestName: testApiInfoReturnsCorrectDescription
  Description: This test is meant to check if the apiInfo method returns an OpenAPI object with the correct description.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as there is no dependency on other methods or data.
  Act: Invoke the apiInfo method without any parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual description of the OpenAPI object against the expected description.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the apiInfo method correctly sets the description of the OpenAPI object. The significance of this test is to ensure that the OpenAPI configuration displays the correct description.

Scenario 4: Test to check the version of the OpenAPI object returned by apiInfo method

Details:
  TestName: testApiInfoReturnsCorrectVersion
  Description: This test is meant to check if the apiInfo method returns an OpenAPI object with the correct version.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as there is no dependency on other methods or data.
  Act: Invoke the apiInfo method without any parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual version of the OpenAPI object against the expected version.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the apiInfo method correctly sets the version of the OpenAPI object. The significance of this test is to ensure that the OpenAPI configuration displays the correct version.
